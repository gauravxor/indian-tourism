## What is Indian Tourism? ü§î
Indian Tourism is a comprehensive full-stack ticket booking web application designed to modernize the travel experience by eliminating paper tickets and introducing QR codes as the primary ticketing system.

### Key Features

* **24/7 Booking Convenience** :  Users can effortlessly book tickets at any time, offering access to a variety of attractions including local amusement parks, historical monuments, museums, and more within their city.
* **QR Code Ticketing System** : Tickets are delivered to the user's email as a unique QR code. This QR code serves as the digital ticket. Upon arrival at the venue, users will present the QR code for scanning, enabling seamless entry after a successful validation.

* **Venue Owner Registration** :  Venue owners can **increases visibility and reach for their business easily** by register their locations on the platform, enabling them to sellüíµ ticketsüé´ for their respective venues.

## Purpose of the Project
The existing ticket booking mechanism faces several flaws, including:

* **Long Queues** : Users often endure long queues, especially during peak hours, resulting in inconvenience, particularly for families.

* **Overcrowding & Safety Concerns** : Peak hours lead to overcrowding at venues, making it challenging to maintain necessary COVID-19 safety protocols such as social distancing.

* **Unlawful Ticket Practices** : The current system encourages unlawful ticket practices, such as purchasing excess tickets for resale at higher price,impacting fair access.

* **Paper Waste** : Traditional paper tickets contribute to environmental waste, consuming resources unnecessarily.

### Hence, Indian Tourism was created to address all these issues.

## Idea of the Project

Several years ago, purchasing movie tickets involved standing in long queues at cinema halls to acquire paper tickets. The evolution of systems like BookMyShow revolutionized this process, eliminating the need for physical queues and paper tickets.

However, while platforms like BookMyShow streamlined ticket bookings for popular venues and cinema halls, they often overlooked local attractions.

Recognizing this gap, the concept of Indian Tourism emerged. The primary idea was to extend the convenience of online ticketing to local venues, encompassing attractions beyond the mainstream, fostering accessibility and convenience for users across a broader spectrum of destinations.

### Bridging the Gap
Indian Tourism aims to bridge this gap by:

* **Inclusivity** : Offering a platform that not only caters to popular venues but also extends its services to local, lesser-known attractions, thus enhancing their visibility and accessibility.
* **Community Engagement** : Fostering a sense of community by empowering local venue owners, enabling them to showcase their offerings and facilitate ticket sales, thereby contributing to the local economy.

## A brief history about the project's structure
<p> In the past, the project was set up as a monorepo, where both the frontend and backend code were stored together in a single repository. As the project expanded, it became too large, so I separated the frontend and backend code into individual repositories.<p>
Both the repositories can be accessed from here.
